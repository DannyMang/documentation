description: "How result caching works in Veri"

## Overview

Veri computes a SHA-256 hash of every image submitted for detection. The `imageHash` and `cached` fields are included in every response to support future caching infrastructure.

<Note>
Caching is not yet active. The `cached` field is currently always `false`. When caching is enabled, previously analyzed images will return instantly without consuming credits.
</Note>

## How It Will Work

1. When you submit an image, Veri computes a SHA-256 hash of the image data
2. If a cached result exists for that hash, it will be returned immediately
3. If not, the image is processed and the result is stored

## Identifying Cached Results

Check the `cached` field in the response:

```python
result = client.detect(image)

if result.cached:
    print("Result from cache")
    print(f"Original detection: {result.timestamp}")
else:
    print("Fresh detection")
```

## Image Hashing

The image hash is based on the raw image bytes. This means:

- **Same image, different format** → Different hash → Analyzed separately
- **Resized image** → Different hash → Analyzed separately
- **Identical bytes** → Same hash → Will use cache when available

```python
# These would be hashed separately (different bytes)
result1 = client.detect(image_as_jpeg)
result2 = client.detect(image_as_png)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use original images** - Don't re-encode before sending to maximize future cache hits
2. **Store the image hash** - Use `result.image_hash` to track what you've analyzed
