## How It Works

Veri uses machine learning models trained to identify artifacts and patterns characteristic of AI-generated images. Our detection pipeline:

1. **Preprocessing** - Normalizes the image for consistent analysis
2. **Model Inference** - Runs the image through our detection model(s)
3. **Score Aggregation** - Combines model outputs into a final confidence score
4. **Classification** - Determines if the image is AI-generated based on threshold

## Detection Models

### veri_face

Our primary model optimized for detecting AI-generated faces. It excels at identifying:

- GAN-generated faces (StyleGAN, PGGAN)
- Diffusion model outputs (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DALL-E)
- Face swaps and deepfakes
- AI-enhanced/modified faces

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average latency | ~150ms |
| Recommended use | Portrait images, profile photos |

## Confidence Scores

The `confidence` field represents how certain the model is that an image is AI-generated:

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 0.0 - 0.3 | Likely authentic |
| 0.3 - 0.5 | Uncertain |
| 0.5 - 0.7 | Possibly AI-generated |
| 0.7 - 1.0 | Likely AI-generated |

<Note>
The default classification threshold is 0.5. Images with confidence >= 0.5 are classified as `is_fake: true`.
</Note>

## Customizing Detection

### Adjusting the Threshold

Lower thresholds catch more AI images but may have more false positives:

```python
from veri import VeriClient, DetectionOptions

client = VeriClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# More sensitive (catch more AI images, more false positives)
result = client.detect(image, options=DetectionOptions(threshold=0.3))

# More conservative (fewer false positives, may miss some AI images)
result = client.detect(image, options=DetectionOptions(threshold=0.7))
```

### Selecting Models

Specify which models to use for detection:

```python
result = client.detect(
    image,
    options=DetectionOptions(models=["veri_face"])
)
```

### Including Raw Outputs

Get raw model outputs for advanced analysis:

```python
result = client.detect(
    image,
    options=DetectionOptions(include_raw=True)
)

for score in result.model_scores:
    print(f"Model: {score.model}")
    print(f"Score: {score.score}")
    print(f"Raw output: {score.raw}")
```

## Best Practices

### Image Quality

For best results:
- Use original, uncompressed images when possible
- Minimum resolution: 224x224 pixels
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF (first frame)

### Rate Your Confidence

Consider the detection context:

```python
result = client.detect(image)

if result.confidence >= 0.8:
    print("High confidence: Very likely AI-generated")
elif result.confidence >= 0.5:
    print("Medium confidence: Possibly AI-generated, review recommended")
else:
    print("Low confidence: Likely authentic")
```

### Handle Edge Cases

Some images are harder to classify:
- Heavily edited photos
- Artistic filters applied
- Very low resolution images
- Partial faces or unusual angles

For these, consider using a higher threshold or manual review.
