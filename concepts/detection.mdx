## How It Works

Veri uses machine learning models trained to identify artifacts and patterns characteristic of AI-generated images. Our detection pipeline:

1. **Preprocessing** - Normalizes the image for consistent analysis
2. **Model Inference** - Runs the image through our detection model(s)
3. **Score Aggregation** - Combines model outputs into a final probability score
4. **Classification** - Maps the score to a 5-tier prediction

## Detection Models

### veri_face

Our primary model optimized for detecting AI-generated faces. It excels at identifying:

- GAN-generated faces (StyleGAN, PGGAN)
- Diffusion model outputs (Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DALL-E)
- Face swaps and deepfakes
- AI-enhanced/modified faces

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average latency | ~150ms |
| Recommended use | Portrait images, profile photos |

## Classification Tiers

The model returns an `ensemble_score` (probability from 0 to 1) which is mapped to a 5-tier classification:

| Score Range | Prediction | Verdict | isFake |
|-------------|------------|---------|--------|
| `>= 0.85` | `ai` | `ai_generated` | `true` |
| `0.55 - 0.85` | `likely_ai` | `likely_ai` | `true` |
| `0.45 - 0.55` | `uncertain` | `uncertain` | `null` |
| `0.15 - 0.45` | `likely_real` | `likely_real` | `false` |
| `< 0.15` | `real` | `real` | `false` |

## Understanding the Response

### `ensemble_score`

The raw model probability (0-1). This is the core output from the detection model. Higher values mean the model thinks the image is more likely AI-generated.

### `confidence`

How decisive the model is, calculated as `abs(ensemble_score - 0.5) * 2`. This tells you how far the model is from being completely unsure:

| ensemble_score | confidence | Meaning |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| 0.95 | 0.90 | Very decisive — strongly believes AI |
| 0.82 | 0.64 | Moderately decisive — leans AI |
| 0.52 | 0.04 | Not decisive — nearly a coin flip |
| 0.30 | 0.40 | Moderately decisive — leans real |
| 0.05 | 0.90 | Very decisive — strongly believes real |

### `isFake`

A convenience boolean derived from `prediction`:
- `true` — prediction is `"ai"` or `"likely_ai"`
- `false` — prediction is `"real"` or `"likely_real"`
- `null` — prediction is `"uncertain"` (score between 0.45 and 0.55)

## Best Practices

### Image Quality

For best results:
- Use original, uncompressed images when possible
- Minimum resolution: 224x224 pixels
- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF (first frame)

### Acting on Results

```python
result = client.detect(image)

if result.prediction == "ai":
    print("High confidence: AI-generated image")
elif result.prediction == "likely_ai":
    print("Likely AI-generated, consider manual review")
elif result.prediction == "uncertain":
    print("Model is unsure, manual review recommended")
elif result.prediction == "likely_real":
    print("Likely authentic")
else:
    print("High confidence: Authentic image")
```

### Handle Edge Cases

Some images are harder to classify:
- Heavily edited photos
- Artistic filters applied
- Very low resolution images
- Partial faces or unusual angles

For these, the model may return `"uncertain"` or `"likely_real"` / `"likely_ai"` predictions with low confidence.
